990,How do I prevent Scrum from turning great developers into average developers?,"First, the motivation to introduce Scrum is never coming from experienced developers, it is always coming from management that feels it is losing control. Then they typically cherry pick some concepts from the book and plant them into the team. False start immediately. As the creators of Scrum state themselves: following Scrum rules by the book is good to get your team out of a ditch but you should not stick to them religiously as you progress. This is lost on most teams because there will be a Scrum master that typically is not the most capable developer and he will only get more serious about the process in time because he finally found something he is good at.
Thus the pull to the average works on multiple levels: not just individually but also on the team level. Only strong teams can survive Scrum and use it to their advantage instead of being suppressed by it. It is not impossible but the environment is working against it, most teams will be effected in one negative way or another.",0

688,What is the best structure for a team ?,"The best structure for a team depends on various factors, including the size of the team, the nature of the work, the objectives of the team, and the culture of the organization. Here are a few of the most common team structures:

Hierarchical structure: In a hierarchical structure, the team is organized into a clear chain of command, with each member reporting to a single supervisor. This structure is common in organizations with a clear division of labor and a well-defined chain of command.

Matrix structure: In a matrix structure, team members have multiple reporting relationships, with each person reporting to more than one supervisor. This structure is common in organizations that require cross-functional teams and flexible reporting relationships.

Self-managed teams: In a self-managed team, team members have a high degree of autonomy and are responsible for managing their own work. This structure is common in organizations that value empowerment and collaboration, and that want to foster a sense of ownership and accountability among team members.

Flat structure: In a flat structure, there is little hierarchy and few formal reporting relationships. This structure is common in organizations that value collaboration, flexibility, and agility, and that want to reduce bureaucracy and minimize layers of management.

Hybrid structure: In a hybrid structure, different parts of the team are organized in different ways, depending on the nature of the work and the objectives of the team. This structure is common in organizations that require a mix of hierarchical, matrix, self-managed, and flat structures, depending on the needs of the team.

Ultimately, the best structure for a team will depend on the specific needs and objectives of the team and the organization, and may involve elements of more than one of the structures listed above. The key is to choose a structure that will enable the team to be effective and to achieve its goals, while also aligning with the culture and values of the organization.

965,Why would the smallness of Alaska's population be a factor in its per-capita energy consumption ranking?,"Considering the quote you posted in your question - ""due to its small population, harsh winters, and energy-intensive industries"".
In addition to harsh winters I'd add lengthy cold periods and the need to keep warm. This would necessitate the need to use energy for prolonged periods not just to keep warm but to survive. I can envisage heating not being turned off during the cold session, which would include parts of autumn and spring.
I'm no expert on Alaska and I don't know what industries the State has, but if it does have energy intensive industries that use a lot of energy for a prolonged period energy usage can quickly accumulate. I'm assuming the military with its bases, the oil and gas sector and the mining industry would factor into this. If one then simply divides the total energy consumed within the State by a small population number, a large number ensues, the units of which would be watts/person. Hence a large per-capita energy usage.",0

935,What's a lion's weakness?,"
They aren’t particularly smart. We often associate lions with bravery. But what one calls bravery often takes on a different meaning when the outcome is poor. Lions will attempt to climb a thin branch to bring down a kill that a leopard brought up, only for the branch to break and injure the lion (rendering a death sentence). A male will sometimes try to fight 4 other males at the same time and get himself killed. The lions often mistake each other for enemy lions and attack friendlies. They’ll sometimes mistake other big cats for invasive lions and fight them, needlessly taking on risks. Males often don’t stick together during night patrols. It’s extremely foolish, not because of hyenas, but because one of their biggest threats is other male coalitions.I say all this as someone who loves lions, and has read and cleaned out all the documentaries on them. We valorize lions because they are beautiful, powerful, and have interesting power structures in their social life.",0

999,Global objects vs free functions C++?,"There is not such a big difference between procedural and object oriented programming as you might think. I found a great definition here: Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class."". So you can think of a class as an isolated piece of software, that communicates with the rest of your program through a well defined interfaces. Implementing the class will give you some overhead, but you gain better control of the things that happen inside your class. OO-programming allows to use simpler approaches (like class-global variables), that otherwise would lead you to a total desaster. I found myself several time starting with a simple concept and writing just free functions (e.g. a fully procedural code). Over time, I found some ""functional units"" in my code, several functions and variables that applied to the same task like accessing a database or creating some graphics. To keep my code clean I then decided to put all those elements together in one class. Often I found this classes useful in other programs, and OO made it really easy to use the code again. But in any case, creating classes was far more effort than writing procedural code. On the other hand, this effort helped to prevent spaghetti code, which was a value on it´s own.",0

974,Agile Principles: What does it mean sustainable development?,"Agile processes are often designed around terms of ""pace"" or ""velocity"", i.e. some measure based on often purely virtually-scaled story points, and some experience about how many story points ""fit"" into a given time interval - a sprint for sprint-based methods, or something else for continuous methods like Kanban. I'll stick with Scrum terms here for simplicity.""Sustainable"" then means that the development team (but also other critical roles like process owners) should do only so much work that they run within their capability; in other words, avoid running into overtime, burnout, stress-induced negligence or other negative outcomes.Depending on the particular agile method employed, there also may be other facets which go into this direction. In Scrum, the Sprint Backlog is arguably the most important artifact of the method; and ideally it is sized such that said ""sustainable"" workload is not surpassed, but also, very importantly, outside changes to the sprint content during the running sprint are highly discouraged. On the other side of the coin, the team promises to finish the stories as best as it can. This means that developers know pretty well what to do in the next 2-3 weeks, and can plan around their upcoming work nicely.",0

971,Is plastic recycling mostly green washing?,"Chemical plastic recycling is viable and creates a product as good as plastic newly created from petroleum. Mechanical, not so much, it leads to poor quality plastic that tears very easily and is unsuitable for food packaging for example due to contamination concerns.There are two ways chemical recycling can be done:
Burn plastic into carbon dioxide (and water). Capture carbon dioxide. Capture waste heat, distributing it in a district heating network. Create hydrogen from water using electrolysis. Combine hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methane. Post-process the methane to create longer chain hydrocarbons, and eventually the plastic molecules you want.Create petrochemicals directly from plastic, avoiding the need to convert it to carbon dioxide by burning and later back to hydrocarbons. Those petrochemicals can then be processed to create the needed plastic molecules. At least Alterra Energy has such a process.Of these options, (2) has probably greater energy efficiency (leading to cheaper recycling), but (1) isn't bad either assuming you have a use for the waste heat. A benefit of (1) is that it allows creating plastic from any waste containing carbon -- cardboard packaging, newspapers, wood and plastic.So if you want to create plastic from wood or paper waste, (1) is the better option. And if you don't want to recycle plastic to a separate stream (which (2) requires) but rather process a single energy waste stream, (1) is better since it can process nearly any waste apart from glass and metal that don't burn.Currently most plastic recycling is mechanical, and that explains why recycled plastic has such a crap quality.",0

969,Is plastic recycling mostly green washing?,"The accepted answer is good, but it is too simple. There is a lot more to it. Between the described advanced processes and mechanical recycling there are a lot of other different processes. The first one was just melting in different stages. In the first stage at a temperature between 100 and 150 degrees Celsius the weakest plastic would melt and would be easily separated. The rest would go to the next stage at higher temperature. The process was rarely implemented because it was expensive. But there are still many processes based on melting or partial melting of scrap plastic in operation, not just mechanical recycling. Just as an example make an internet search with the keywords plastic tarmac.The real reason why what is being told to the public changed so much is the energy cost. Not only the rise in the price of fossil fuels pushed up all the other costs, it also increased the cost of plastic recycling. On the other side a lot of countries began to use rubbish incinerators to generate energy, but rubbish does not contain so much energy, so it was decided to beef up the energy content by reducing the amount of plastic that is recycled. Everything else is just confusion created on purpose.",0

Another benefit of choosing an API over a nuget package is you don't force an implementation requirement to use the code.

956,What is overfitting and How to prevent overfitting?,"Overfitting is a type of modeling error that results in the failure to predict future observations effectively or fit additional data in the existing model. It occurs when a function is too closely fit a limited set of data points and usually ends with more parameters than the data can accommodate. It is common for huge data sets to have some anomalies, so when this data is used for any kind of modeling, it can result in inaccuracies in the analysis. Overfitting can be prevented by following a few methods namely- Cross-validation: Where the initial training data is split into several mini-test sets and each mini-data set is used to tune the model. Remove features: Remove irrelevant features manually from the algorithms and use feature selection heuristics to identify the important features Regularisation: This involves various ways of making your model simpler so that there’s little room for error due to obscurity. Adding penalty parameters and pruning your decision tree are ways of doing that. Ensembling: These are machine learning techniques for combining multiple separate predictions. The most popular methods of ensembling are bagging and boosting.",0

Tab keys are important for people with motor impairments, as these people often can't use a mouse and navigate around web pages using the tab key instead. Making them press a keyboard combination instead of a single key would be detrimental to the accessibility of your keyboard design. Many people without disabilities also use the tab key when navigating a form in particular. The fastest way to get from one form field to the next is by pressing tab rather than reaching for the mouse. Turning the tab function into a keyboard combination adds friction and makes that action more difficult.

Firstly, a lot of these courses make use of frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras to implement Neural Networks and optimization algorithms like gradient descent. Try implementing these with nothing but NumPy or SciPy. Still find it easy? I’ll wait.
A lot of the courses focus on an “intuitive” understanding of the Mathematics rather than the actual hardcore stuff. I remember doing Andrew Ng’s renowned ML course where, in many cases, the implication of several equations were shown as opposed to describing how they were derived. I found myself deriving some of them on my own just out of curiosity!",0

It is used to cycle between elements - both on websites/within apps, but also between different windows with alt+tab. Cycling backwards is done via (alt+)shift+tab.
It is used to switch between different working modes in some applications (eg Blender, Ableton Live)
It is used in games as the inventory/menu button (with Esc being a more ""system"" focused menu usually), or to open some other overlay (eg Steam's shift+tab).
In general, since the tab key is very prominently and easy to access, and it's original ""insert tabs into this text"" function is very rarely relevant, tab has become a swiss-army-knife kind of thing in practice - if you have an important mode/menu/widget which needs to be easily accessible, tab is probably where it'll end up.",0

681,What are the ethical considerations of AI?,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to bring about many positive changes in society, but it also raises a number of ethical considerations. Some of the key ethical considerations associated with AI include:

Bias and discrimination: AI algorithms can be biased and perpetuate discrimination if they are trained on biased data or if the algorithms themselves have a biased design. This can result in unfair treatment of certain groups, such as racial and gender minorities.

Privacy: AI algorithms collect and process large amounts of personal data, which raises privacy concerns. There is a risk that this data may be used for purposes other than those for which it was collected, such as targeted advertising or political manipulation.

Responsibility and accountability: As AI systems become more advanced, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine who is responsible for the decisions made by these systems. This raises questions about accountability and responsibility when AI systems cause harm.

Job displacement: AI has the potential to automate many tasks that are currently performed by humans, which raises concerns about job displacement and the impact on employment and the economy.

Transparency and interpretability: AI algorithms can be complex and difficult to understand, which raises questions about transparency and interpretability. This is important for ensuring that AI systems are trustworthy and that their decisions can be challenged and audited.

Autonomy and control: As AI systems become more advanced, they may be capable of making decisions and taking actions without human intervention. This raises ethical questions about the limits of AI autonomy and who has control over these systems.

These are just a few of the ethical considerations associated with AI, and it is important for society to continue to engage in ongoing discussions about the ethical implications of this technology and how it can be developed and used in a responsible and ethical way",1
