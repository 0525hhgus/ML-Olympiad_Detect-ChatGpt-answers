This is kind of a pain and means you are discarding a decent chunk of onion, so I don't like it too much.Another option is to use a fan to blow the gases away from you. A small fan next to you blowing horizontally should do the trick.You could also wear goggles, although you'd have to leave them on for a while until the gas dissipates from the area.Another technique is to cut a lemon in half and rub the fresh lemon against both sides of the blade. You'll have to keep ""refreshing"" the juice coat and your onions will have some lemon juice on them, so this is somewhat limited by that factor."

One day, I was puzzled by a certain construct in the C++ language.Now, Stroustrup was also an employee at AT&T Bell Labs. His name and number was listed in the company directory.

I posed my question to him and told him that I had already consulted his C++ book. Without any delay whatsoever, and I mean instantly, he told me to “turn to page X” (I honestly don’t remember the page # after so many years, but it was a very specific topic deep in the book, say on page 197). And I remember that I did not hear any sound of him picking up his book, going through the pages; really, no time elapsed for any of that. It was more akin to a Jennings-level Jeopardy! contestant already providing an answer while the question is still in the process of being asked.Sure enough, my question had a clear answer on that very page! I was just amazed how he knew the page # by heart! I thanked him and hung up. I thought to myself, no wonder he came up with the language, and wrote the cfront preprocessor all by himself! :)"

Either way, I would personally not use a NuGet package to share code internally. I'd share my repo and toss a DLL on a wiki (or shared drive or whatever) -- for consumers who don't want to continually recompile my code."

943,Can GPT replace coders doing development?,"No. It’s at best a tool. Such a program isn’t planning software nor does it “think”, it is answering queries (as in, dipping into and statistically cobbling together based on data [it is given/scored] what might be what is requested, that includes things that look like what is being requested) and furthermore it lacks the ability to check its own results with 100% certainty (as in, it can provide a proof for you that its results are correct, as opposed to just asserting it). That means you can’t blindly trust it, you aren’t being given a proof (that one can check) that results are correct (where you can accept/reject the results). Such things do not work well (to the standard perhaps I would expect when discussing program correctness) in a domain where you need exact specificity; being slightly wrong is being wrong, and can create a lot of frustration. One needs to be careful blindly trusting (which is what it would mean if you replaced a coder with such a tool) something that provides no proof for you it is providing correct results in a domain where correctness matters usually most times.

997,Global objects vs free functions C++?,"Classes should be used to organize your code, not as a ""spagehtti container"". Each class should only apply to a single, relatively simple task, and often it is not a single class, but a hierarchy of classes you will use.Assume you have a progam that displays - beside many other things it does - some graphics. So it could be a good Idea to put all your graphics functions together in a separate code module. One function paints a circle, the other a rectanlge. Now you will find, that all your functions do very similar things, like open your graphics device, ceate some canvas and perform the painting. That is the time to create a ""parent"" class, that performs all the common stuff. All the childred will inherit the common stuff an will only need to do, what is specific for them. This saves a lot of redundancy and makes your code easier to maintain. But each class should be as simple as possible, one class - one task!"
