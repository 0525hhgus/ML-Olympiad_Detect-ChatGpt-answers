from the book and plant them into the team. false start immediately. as the creators of scrum state themselves following scrum rules by the book is good to get your team out of a ditch but you should not stick to them religiously as you progress. this is lost on most teams because there will be a scrum master that typically is not the most capable developer and he will only get more serious about the process in time because he finally found something he is good at.thus the pull to the average works on multiple levels not just individually but also on the team level. only strong teams can

team team members have a high degree of autonomy and are responsible for managing their own work. this structure is common in organizations that value empowerment and collaboration and that want to foster a sense of ownership and accountability among team members.flat structure in a flat structure there is little hierarchy and few formal reporting relationships. this structure is common in

methane. postprocess the methane to create longer chain hydrocarbons and eventually the plastic molecules you want.create petrochemicals directly from plastic avoiding the need to convert it to carbon dioxide by burning and later back to hydrocarbons. those petrochemicals can then be processed to create the needed plastic molecules. at least alterra energy has such a process.of these options has probably greater energy efficiency but is not bad either assuming you have a use for the waste heat. a benefit of is that it allows creating plastic from any waste containing carbon cardboard packaging newspapers wood and plastic.so if you want to create plastic from wood or paper waste is the better option. and if you do not want to recycle plastic to a separate stream requires but rather

there are a lot of other different processes. the first one was just melting in different stages. in the first stage at a temperature between 100 and 150 degrees celsius the weakest plastic would melt and would be easily separated. the rest would go to the next stage at higher temperature. the process was rarely implemented because it was expensive. but there are still many processes based on melting or partial melting of scrap plastic in operation not just mechanical recycling. just as an example make an internet search with the keywords plastic tarmac.the real reason why what is being told to the public changed so much is the energy cost. not only the rise in the price of fossil fuels pushed up all the other costs it also increased the cost of plastic recycling. on the other side a

data can accommodate. it is common for huge data sets to have some anomalies so when this data is used for any kind of modeling it can result in inaccuracies in the analysis. overfitting can be prevented by following a few methods namely crossvalidation where the initial training data is split into several minitest sets and each minidata set is used to tune the model. remove features remove irrelevant features manually from the algorithms and use feature selection heuristics to identify the important features regularisation this involves various ways of making your model simpler so that

raises a number of ethical considerations. some of the key ethical considerations associated with ai includebias and discrimination ai algorithms can be biased and perpetuate discrimination if they are trained on biased data or if the algorithms themselves have a biased design. this can result in unfair treatment of certain groups such as racial and gender minorities.privacy ai algorithms collect and process large amounts of personal data which raises privacy concerns. there is a risk that this data may be used for purposes other than those for which it was collected such as targeted advertising or political manipulation.responsibility and accountability as ai systems become more advanced it becomes increasingly difficult to determine who is responsible for the decisions made by these systems. this raises questions about accountability and responsibility when ai systems cause harm.job displacement ai has the potential to automate many tasks that are currently performed by humans which raises concerns about job displacement and the impact on employment and the economy.transparency and interpretability ai algorithms can be complex and difficult to understand which raises questions about transparency and interpretability. this is important for ensuring that ai systems are trustworthy and that their decisions can be challenged and audited.autonomy and control as ai systems become more advanced they may be capable of making decisions and taking actions without human intervention. this raises ethical questions about the limits of ai autonomy and who has control over these systems.these are just a few of the ethical considerations associated with ai and it is important for society to continue to engage in ongoing discussions about the ethical implications of

them into the team. false start immediately. as the creators of scrum state themselves following scrum rules by the book is good to get your team out of a ditch but you should not stick to them religiously as you progress. this is lost on most teams because there will be a scrum master that typically is not the most capable developer and he will only get more serious about the process in time because he finally found something he is good at.thus the pull to the average works on multiple levels not just individually but also on the team level. only strong teams can survive scrum and

organizations with a clear division of labor and a welldefined chain of command.matrix structure in a matrix structure team members have multiple reporting relationships with each person reporting to more than one supervisor. this structure is common in organizations that require crossfunctional teams and flexible reporting relationships.selfmanaged teams in a selfmanaged team team members have a high degree of autonomy and are responsible for managing their own work. this structure is common in organizations that value empowerment and collaboration and that want to foster a sense of ownership and accountability among team members.flat structure in a flat structure there is little hierarchy and few formal reporting relationships. this structure is common in organizations that value
